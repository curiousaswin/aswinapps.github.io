        <h1>Stars</h1>
       <p>
    Stars are giant spheres of extremely hot gas made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. Stars get so hot by burning hydrogen into helium in a process called nuclear fusion. This is what makes them so hot and bright. Most of the stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They twinkle because of movement in the Earth's atmosphere. Many stars come in pairs called binary stars. There are some groupings with up to 4 stars. The smaller they are the longer they live. Giant stars are bright, but tend to burn out fast
</p>
<h2>
    Lifecycle of a star
</h2>
<p>
    All stars start as giant clouds of dust which is called nebulae. The gravity forces the dust to bunch together. As more and more dust bunches up together,the  gravity gets stronger and it starts to get hot and becomes which is called a protostar. Once the center of the star gets hot enough, nuclear fusion will begin and a young star is born.The sun will continue to burn energy and glow for billions of years. This is the state of the star for the majority of its life and is called the main sequence. During this time a balance is met between gravity wanting to shrink the star and heat wanting to make it grow bigger. The star will remain this way until it runs out of hydrogen. After it runs out of hydrogen,the outer layer of the star expands and it becomes a red giant. A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature around 5,000 K or lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars. After a lot of time, the core of the star will start to make iron. This will cause the star to collaspe.A neutron star is created from the collapse of a giant star. It's very tiny, but very dense.</p>
    <h2>
        Types of Stars
    </h2>
    <p>There are many different types of stars. Stars that are in their main sequence are categorized by their color. The smallest stars are red and don't give off much of a glow. Medium size stars are yellow, like the Sun. The largest stars are blue and are hugely bright. The larger the main sequence star, the hotter and brighter they are.</p>
    <h2>
        Dwarfs
    </h2>
    <p>Smaller stars are called dwarf stars. Red and yellow stars are generally called dwarfs. A brown dwarf is one that never quite got large enough for nuclear fusion to occur. A white dwarf is the smaller parts  of the collapse of a red giant star.
<h2>
    Giants
</h2>
<p>Giant stars can be main sequence stars like a blue giant. Some stars that are expanding like red giants are also giant stars.It can be as big as a solar system.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sun" class="bg-warning"> 
        <h1>Sun</h1>
        <p>
    The Sun is a actually yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the center of our solar system. The sun's gravity holds the solar system together that  keeps everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris that is in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth create the seasons, ocean currents, weather, and climate. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.
</p>
<h2>
    Size and Distance
</h2>
<p>The sun has a radius of 432,168.6 miles or 695,508 kilometers. The Sun is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers from Earth.The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. </p>
<h2>
    Orbit and Rotation
</h2>
<p>
    The sun is located in the Milky Way galaxy. The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy that  brings the planets, asteroids, comets and other objects along with it on its rotation. The sun takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way. Its spin has an axial tilt of 7.25 degrees with some respect to the plane of all the planets’ orbits. Because the sun does not have a solid body, different parts of the Sun rotate at different rates.  At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 days, but at its poles the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.
</p>
<h2>
    Formation
</h2>
<p>
    The Sun and the rest of the solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust called a solar nebula about 4.5 billion years ago. As the nebula collapsed because of its overwhelming gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the entire solar system.

Like all stars, the Sun will someday run out of energy. When the Sun starts to die, it will swell so big that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 6.5 billion years before it shrinks down to be a white dwarf.
</p>
<h2>
    Structure 
</h2>
<p>
    The Sun, like others stars, is a ball of gas. In terms of the number of atoms, it is made of 91.0% hydrogen and 8.9% helium. By mass, the Sun is about 70.6% hydrogen and 27.4% helium. The Sun's enormous mass is held together by gravitational attraction, producing immense pressure and temperature at its core. The Sun has six regions which are the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the visible surface, called the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the outermost region, the corona. The temperature is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit or 15 million degrees Celsius, which is sufficient to sustain thermonuclear fusion. The energy produced in the core powers the Sun and produces all the heat and light the Sun emits. Energy from the core is carried outward by radiation, which bounces around the radiative zone, taking about 170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convective zone. The temperature drops below 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius) in the convective zone, where large bubbles of hot plasma (a soup of ionized atoms) move upwards. The surface of the Sun—the part we can see—is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius). That's much cooler than the blazing core, but it's still hot enough to make carbon, like diamonds and graphite, not just melt, but boil.
</p>
<h2>
    Surface
</h2>
<p>
    The surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is a 300-mile-thick or 500-kilometer-thick region, from which most of the Sun's radiation escapes outward. This is not a solid surface like the surfaces of planets. Instead, this is the outer layer of the gassy star.

We see radiation from the photosphere as sunlight when it reaches Earth about eight minutes after it leaves the Sun. The temperature of the photosphere is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit or 5,500 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<h2>
    Atmoshprere
</h2>
<p>Above the photosphere lie the tenuous chromosphere and the corona (crown), which make up the thin solar atmosphere. This is where we see features such as sunspots and solar flares.

    Visible light from these top regions is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter photosphere, but during total solar eclipses, when the moon covers the photosphere, the chromosphere looks like a red rim around the Sun, while the corona forms a beautiful white crown with plasma streamers narrowing outward, forming shapes that look like flower petals.
    
    Strangely, the temperature in the Sun's atmosphere increases with altitude, reaching as high as 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius). The source of coronal heating has been a scientific mystery for more than 50 years.</p>
<h2>
    Magnetosphere
</h2>
<p>
    The electric currents in the Sun generate a complex magnetic field that extends out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field. The volume of space controlled by the Sun's magnetic field is called the heliosphere.

The Sun's magnetic field is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind—a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. Since the Sun rotates, the magnetic field spins out into a large rotating spiral, known as the Parker spiral.

The Sun doesn't behave the same way all the time. It goes through phases of its own solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s geographic poles change their magnetic polarity. When this happens, the Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona undergo changes from quiet and calm to violently active. The height of the Sun’s activity, known as solar maximum, is a time of solar storms: sunspots, solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These are caused by irregularities in the Sun's magnetic field and can release huge amounts of energy and particles, some of which reach us here on Earth. This space weather can damage satellites, corrode pipelines and affect power grids

        <h1>About Mercury</h1>
        <center><h2>About Mercury's Gravity</h2></center>
        <p>
  Mercury's Gravity is 3.7 m/s².
</p>
<center>
<h2>
  About Mercury's Atmoshpere
</h2></center>
<p>Mercury has a very tenuous and highly variable atmosphere (surface-bound exosphere) containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium and water vapor, with a combined pressure level of about 10−14 bar (1 nPa).[2] The exospheric species originate either from the Solar wind or from the planetary crust. Solar light pushes the atmospheric gases away from the Sun, creating a comet-like tail behind the planet.</p>
<h2>
  About Mercury's Poles
</h2>
<p>The poles of Mercury and the Moon are among the coldest places in our solar system. Unlike Earth, the spin axes of Mercury and the Moon are oriented such that, in their polar regions, the Sun never rises high above the horizon. Consequently, polar topographic depressions, such as impact craters, never see the Sun.</p>
<h2>
<center>
About Mercury's Rotation
</center>
</h2>
<p>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days—just over two years on Mercury.</p>

  About Venus' Atmoshpere
</h2>
<p>Venus' atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. The thick atmosphere traps the Sun's heat, resulting in surface temperatures higher than 880 degrees Fahrenheit (470 degrees Celsius). The atmosphere has many layers with different temperatures. At the level where the clouds are, about 30 miles up from the surface, it's about the same temperature as on the surface of the Earth.
As Venus moves forward in its solar orbit while slowly rotating backwards on its axis, the top level of clouds zips around the planet every four Earth days, driven by hurricane-force winds traveling at about 224 miles (360 kilometers) per hour. Atmospheric lightning bursts light up these quick-moving clouds. Speeds within the clouds decrease with cloud height, and at the surface are estimated to be just a few miles per hour.</p>
<h2>
  About Venus' Poles
</h2>
<p>
  There akre groups of ridges near each pole. These ridges rise a few kilometers above the lower plains. They are up to hundreds of kilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long. One group of ridges is in Lavinia Planitia near the South Pole. Another set of ridges is next to Atalanta Planitia near the North Pole. Venus isn't tilted on its axis very much. 
</p>
<h2>
<center>
About Venus' Rotation
</center>
</h2>
<p>Venus' rotation and orbit are unusual in several ways. Venus is one of just two planets that rotate from east to west. Only Venus and Uranus have this "backwards" rotation. It completes one rotation in 243 Earth days — the longest day of any planet in our solar system, even longer than a whole year on Venus. But the Sun doesn't rise and set each "day" on Venus like it does on most other planets. On Venus, one day-night cycle takes 117 Earth days because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around the Sun.

  Venus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Venusian time) in 225 Earth days or slightly less than two Venusian day-night cycles. Its orbit around the Sun is the most circular of any planet — nearly a perfect circle. Other planet's orbits are more elliptical, or oval-shaped.</p>

  Venus has two large highland areas: Ishtar Terra, about the size of Australia, in the north polar region; and Aphrodite Terra, about the size of South America, straddling the equator and extending for almost 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers). Venus is covered in craters, but none are smaller than 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) across.

<p>Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron oxide dust.

  Although Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past.</p>

What Moons?
</center>
</h2>
<p>
<u>
Earth has 1 moon:
</u>
<br>
(Earth's Moon has no name)
<h2><center>About Earth's Moon</center></h2>
<p>
    The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.
The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago. The moon has a radius of 1,080 miles or 1,740 kilometers. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon.

The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting about an inch farther away each year. The Moon is rotating at the same rate that it revolves around Earth (called synchronous rotation), so the same hemisphere faces Earth all the time. Some people call the far side – the hemisphere we never see from Earth – the "dark side" but that's misleading. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts are in sunlight or darkness at different times. The changing illumination is why, from our perspective, the Moon goes through phases. During a "full Moon," the hemisphere of the Moon we can see from Earth is fully illuminated by the Sun. And a "new Moon" occurs when the far side of the Moon has full sunlight, and the side facing us is having its night.

The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth in 27 Earth days and rotates or spins at that same rate, or in that same amount of time. Because Earth is moving as well – rotating on its axis as it orbits the Sun – from our perspective, the Moon appears to orbit us every 29 days. Earth's Moon has a core, mantle, and crust just like Earth.

<u>
Mars Has 2 confirmed moons:
</u>
<br>
Deimos
<br>
Phobes
</p>
<h2>
   <center>About Deimos</center> 
</h2>
<p>Deimos has a mean radius of 6.2 km or 3.9 mi and takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars. Deimos is 23,460 km or 14,580 mi from Mars, much further than Mars's other moon, which is Phobos. 
    Deimos is composed of rock rich in carbonaceous material, much like C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Deimos is possibly an asteroid that was perturbed by Jupiter into an orbit that allowed it to be captured by Mars, though this hypothesis is still controversial and disputed. Deimos regularly passes in front of the Sun when we see from Mars. 
</p>
<h2>
    <center> About Phobes</center> 
</h2>
<p>Phobes has a mean radius of 11 km or 7 mi. It is so close that it orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates, and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes. Phobos has dimensions of 27 km × 22 km × 18 km, and retains too little mass to be rounded under its own gravity.
    Phobos's density is too low to be solid rock, and it is known to have significant porosity.These results led to the suggestion that Phobos might contain a substantial reservoir of ice.

<h2>About Amalthea</h2>
The moon Amalthea is one of Jupiter's  named satellites. Amalthea was the first to be discovered after the four Galilean moons, and it is the fifth-largest overall. In terms of proximity to Jupiter, Amalthea is the Jupiter's third moon — it takes just 12 hours to make a complete orbit.
<h2>About Adrastea</h2>
<p>Adrastea is one of the two closest moons  that orbits inside what is called the synchronous orbit radius of Jupiter. That is, Adrastea orbits Jupiter faster than Jupiter rotates on its axis. At this distance, Adrastea's orbit will eventually decay and it will fall into the planet as scientists fear.</p>
<h2>About Aitne</h2>
<p>Aitne, also known as Jupiter XXXI, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard, in 2001, and given the temporary designation S/2001 J 11.</p>
<h2><center>About Ananke</center></h2>
<p>Ananke is a retrograde irregular moon of Jupiter. Ananke was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1951 and is named after the mythical Ananke, the personification of Necessity, and the mother of the Moirai by Zeus.</p>
<h2>
    <center>About Aoede</center>
</h2>
<p>Aoede, which is also known as Jupiter XLI, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003. </p>
<h2><center>About Arche</center></h2>
<p>Arche is a member of the Carme group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and appearance and are therefore thought to have a common origin. The group probably began as a D-type asteroid (possibly from the Hilda family or the Jupiter Trojans) that suffered a collision, which broke off a number of pieces, either before or after being captured by Jupiter's gravity. The largest remaining chunk (still retaining 99 percent of the group's mass) was named "Carme," and the smaller pieces became the other 16 moons in the Carme group.</p>
<h2><center>About Autonoe</center></h2>
<p>Autonoe is considered a member of the Pasiphae group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and are therefore thought to have a common origin.

Most or all of the Pasiphae satellites are thought to have begun as a single asteroid that, after being captured by Jupiter's gravity, suffered a collision which broke off a number of pieces. The bulk of the original asteroid survived as the moon called Pasiphae, and the other pieces became some or all of the other moons in the group.</p>
<h2><CENTER>About Callirrhoe</CENTER></h2>
<P>
Callirrhoe was discovered Oct. 19, 1999 via the 36-inch telescope on Kitt Peak, in the course of observations by the Spacewatch program of the University of Arizona. It was initially thought to be an asteroid, but calculations of its orbit by the Minor Planet Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory revealed it to be a satellite of Jupiter.</P>
<h2><center>About Callisto</center></h2>
<p>Callisto is Jupiter's second largest moon and the third largest moon in our solar system. Its surface is the most heavily cratered of any object in our solar system. Images of Callisto captured by passing spacecraft show bright white spots standing out against darker regions.</p>
<h2><Center>About Carme</Center></h2>
<p>With a mean radius of 14 miles (23 km), Carme is the largest member of the Carme group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and appearance and are therefore thought to have a common origin. Carme was probably a D-type asteroid (possibly from the Hilda family or the Jupiter Trojans) that suffered a collision, which broke off a number of pieces, either before or after being captured by Jupiter's gravity. Those pieces became the other 16 moons in the Carme group. Carme still retains 99 percent of the total mass of the group.</p>
<h2><center>About Carpo</center></h2>
<p>Carpo, some 1.9 miles (3 km) across (assuming an albedo of 0.04), orbits Jupiter at a distance of about 10.5 million miles (17 million km). It takes a little over 456 Earth days to complete one orbit.</p>
<h2><center>About Chaldene</center></h2>
<p>Chaldene is a member of the Carme group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and appearance and are therefore thought to have a common origin. </p>
<h2><center>About Cyllene</center></h2>
<p>
    Cyllene is considered a member of the Pasiphae group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and are therefore thought to have a common origin.

Most or all of the Pasiphae satellites are thought to have begun as a single asteroid that, after being captured by Jupiter's gravity, suffered a collision which broke off a number of pieces.

        About Dia
    </center>
</h2>
<p>
    Dia was discovered in 2000.Dia has a prograde orbit and a radius of about 1.2 miles (2 km), also is among the smallest member of the Himalia group.
</p>
<h2> <center>About Eirne </center></h2>

<p>
Eirene was discovered in February 2003.
Eirene is a member of the Carme group.Eirene has a mean radius of about 1.2 miles (2 kilometers). At a mean distance of about 15 million miles (23.5 million kilometers) from Jupiter, the satellite takes about 739 Earth days to complete one orbit.</p>
<h2><center>About Elara</center></h2>
<p>Elara was discovered in 1905. It is the 8th largest moon of the planet Jupiter. It has a mean radius of mean radius of 26.7 miles, which is 43 kilometers.. Unfortunatley, it's only about 2 percent the size of Europa, which is the smallest of the four Galilean moons. It is half as big as Himalia.</p>
